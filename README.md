# Web-Crawler
This is a very simple demonstration of a web crawler which works as below:
  It first extracts the available links in the initial link up to the limit number. 
  Then makes a dictionary of the words in those links and creates posting lists for each word. These lists are stored in a .txt file.
  The file created will then be used to perform boolean retrieval of the input query and return the link to websites containing the query words.
